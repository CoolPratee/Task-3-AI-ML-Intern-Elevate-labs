# 🏠 House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements Simple and Multiple Linear Regression to predict house prices using a housing dataset.

## 🎯 Objective
- Understand regression modeling
- Train Linear Regression model
- Evaluate model performance

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## 📊 Steps Performed
1. Loaded dataset using Pandas
2. Converted categorical variables into numeric using one-hot encoding
3. Split data into training and testing sets
4. Trained Linear Regression model
5. Evaluated using:
   - MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
   - MSE (Mean Squared Error)
   - R² Score
6. Visualized actual vs predicted values

## 📈 Results
- Model performance was evaluated using regression metrics.
- R² score shows how well the model explains variance.

## 📌 Conclusion
Linear Regression provides a good baseline model for house price prediction. More advanced models can further improve accuracy.
